# Process
Here first, I built my docker files and pushed my images to DockerHub.
```console
docker build -t istvan1997/mysql:latest .
docker push istvan1997/mysql:latest
docker build -t istvan1997/wordpress:latest .
docker push istvan1997/wordpress:latest
```
After doing so, I modified the compose file from Lab3/Teil1 to test the images.
It worked. I hope nothing was cached that could influence its future behaviour...

Afterwards, I watched the video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_o8dwzRlu4&t), installing minikube in the process for later. 
I used the following command to do this:
```console
winget install minikube
```
Weirdly, minikubes' directory was added to the Path environment variable inside the System variables, but not to the user-specific variable, so I had to go in and do it manually...
I needed to define my encode my secret values in Base64, for which I used this website: https://www.base64encode.org/
After that, I just followed the tutorial and adjusted things to fit the assignment.
Soon, I needed to use the following commands actually to get my Kubernetes cluster up and running.
```console
kubectl apply -f mysql-secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f wordpress-secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f mysql.yaml
kubectl apply -f wordpress-config.yaml
kubectl apply -f wordpress.yaml
kubectl get all # These I ran to check whether everything went fine or not.
kubectl get configMap
kubectl get secret
```
Afterwards, I encountered two problems. First, I could not connect to my minikube client. This was not that hard to solve: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/accessing/
The following comment was needed to find the actual IP of the WordPress client.
```console 
minikube service --url wordpress-service
```
As for the second one, I gave the same host to WordPress as I did in the compose file ups...
After making sure that it worked, I was about to work on pushing it to Azure when I thought I should give these volumes. Then I found this: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateful-application/mysql-wordpress-persistent-volume/
**Internal Screaming**
After adjusting my YAML files to similar ones in the example above, I encountered a problem. Namely, the pods did not want to work. I figured out quickly that I did not have enough space for the volumes... So I adjusted the numbers a bit, and after waiting a bit, they worked again.
The next problem was, the WordPress files were gone. After a bit of research, it turns out Kubernetes overwrites them for the volume. So after a bit more research, I decided that you know what, WordPress should be stateless and thus removed its volume. After that, I also gave up on the volumes for MySQL. ~~It just kept on crashing for no apparent reason.~~ After going into the cli (**kubectl exec --stdin --tty shell-demo -- /bin/bash**), checking the logs using **kubectl logs mypod -p**. I realized it had the same problem as WordPress. So I just decided to leave everything stateless. The tutorial said that normally one does not mess around with states here anyways.
Finally, I manually did everything else on Azure, following your steps.
I had to play around a bit, as my subscription did not allow for more than six virtual cores, among other things.
See the image below for the final settings
![Azure Kubernetes Config](Images/Azure_Kubernetes_Config.PNG)

After that, I added the credentials using the top commands from the image:
![Azure Kubernetes Commands](Images/Azure_Kubernetes_Commands.PNG)

Then I pushed my things using the following commands:
```console
kubectl apply -f mysql-secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f wordpress-secret.yaml
kubectl apply -f mysql.yaml
kubectl apply -f wordpress-config.yaml
kubectl apply -f wordpress.yaml
```
Here I noticed that NodePort was the wrong kind of service type, so I changed it to a LoadBalancer.
After adjusting that, I reapplied WordPress **kubectl apply -f wordpress.yaml**.
After that, it worked, sometimes. My MySQL image was unstable; I managed to connect from time to time but not always, as it would restart every now and then. I tried it with the original images, and it worked fine, so my Kubernetes files are fine.
See images below for when it worked:
![Wordpress Service with LoadBalancer](Images/Working.PNG)
![Wordpress Hello World](Images/Working2.PNG)

## PS
After thinking about it, I decided to use the official MySQL image, instead of my own, as that one is stable.

## Composition
My solution consists of the following files:
+ mysql-secret.yaml  
This is the file where the secret values, such as database user + password are stored for the mysql database.

+ mysql.yaml  
This is the deployment + service file for the MySQL database.

+ wordpress-secret.yaml  
This is the file where the secret values, such as database user + password, are stored. These are needed to access the database.

+ wordpress-config.yaml  
This is the file that stores information that can be visible to others.

+ wordpress.yaml  
This is the deployment + service file for the wordpress app.  

On a side note: secret files are not entirely safe. They only use encrypted data based on Base64, which is it, so in production, they would need an extra layer (according to the tutorial.)

## Critic
I did not think that Kubernetes and Docker worked so badly together. I mean, while one thing works in Docker in one way, it is not guaranteed to work with Kubernetes the same way, such as volumes.
